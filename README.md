This   is your second year   preparing Zendor’s   income tax   return.
Zendor   has given you   an   Excel file with a   list   of   all   his   transactions   for   2024.      He   has   said that   he   is   not certain whether   everything   relates to   his   business, and that   it   may include some   items from other years.    You   made a   note   to   watch   for   items   from   years   other than 2024 and to carefully   consider whether transactions   are   applicable   for income tax   purposes.
Additional Information 
1.          Zendor   is 52 years old and   lives   in   London,   Ontario.      His   revenue   comes from
providing electrical services for   businesses   in   London and   in   Kitchener.      He tracks
the   revenue from these two   locations separately   in   order to   best   understand   his   business profitability.
2.          Zendor   is   married to   Barbara, age 48, who   is disabled.   She   receives   a   disability   pension   of   $1,000   per   month and   has a T-2201 that   has   been accepted   by   CRA.
The couple   has one son, Adam, who   is   20 years   old,   in good   health,   and   attends   university   full   time.   Adam’stuition for 2024 was $16,000.      He earned $20,000   working   during   the   summer.      He   would like to transfer as   much of his   tuition tax   credit   to   his   father   as   possible.
Barbara’smother, Janice,   is 73 years old and   lives with the family.      She   is   in   good   health   and   has pension   income of $36,000   per year. She   helps take care   of the   home   and   does   things   that   Barbara   is   unable to   do.    She does   not   receive any compensation   for   this. 
3. Home office expenses: One   room   in   Zendor’s   home   is   dedicated   solely   as   his   business   office.   It   is
the only   place that   he   uses as an office.      The   office   occupies   12%   of   the   floor   space   of the   home.
Zendor does all   his administrative work   in this   office,   including   purchasing   supplies,   scheduling jobs,   and   billing customers. The following   home office expenses were   incurred   in   2024:
• Utilities –   heat and water
•            Internet   (used   60% for   personal   purposes)
•            Municipal   property tax – City of   London
•          Office supplies –   pens,   paper,   toner   for   printer,   etc.
• Office   furniture   -   new   desk   and   chair
4. Van expenses: On January   1, 2024, Zendor   sold   a   customized van   for   $15,000   that   he   had   purchased   for $80,000 and   had a   UCC of $5,650.      This   was   the   only   item   in   its   UCC   class.      On   the   same   day   he purchased a   new   customized van.    He   paid for the   new   van   with   the   $15,000   from   the   sale   of the   old      vanand wrote a cheque for the   additional   remaining cost.      Both vans   could   hold two   passengers   (the      driver and one other) and were   used   exclusively to   bring   workers   and   supplies to   work   sites.      The   old      van was   not a zero-emissions vehicle;   however, the   new van was   a   zero-emissions   vehicle.      Operating   expenses   included gas, auto   insurance, vehicle   license    registration.    Zendor does   not   use the van for any   personal   purposes.    He   has a   separate   personal   automobile   that   is   not   used for   the   business.   None of the   personal automobile’s costs are   on the   Excel   file   you   were   given.
5. Travel expenses (other than van): Because of the   distance,   Zendor   stays   overnight   at   a   hotel   in   Kitchener when   he   does work there that will take   more than one   day.   He   eats   his   meals   at   local      restaurants.
In August   2024, Zendor flew to Vancouver to   attended a three-day   Electrician’s   Convention at the         Vancouver   Heritage   Hotel   in Vancouver,   BC.    He attends this   convention   every year,   as   it   is   a   good         opportunity   to   catchup   on   the   latest   electrical   devices   and   techniques.    This   year,   Adam   went   with Zendor so that   he could spend sometime exploring   Vancouver.      Zendor   extended   the   stay   at   the hotel   by two extra days to allow   extra   time   to   spend with   his   son.    No   meals were   provided   by the   conference. Zendor spent $200 on   meals   each   day   in Vancouver.    This was   equally   split   between meals for   himself and   meals for Adam. 
6. General Expenses: In 2024, Zendor   paid for   a   membership   in   Electrical   Contractor   Association   of   Ontario.    He also   has a   magazine   subscription to   Electrical   Contractor   Magazine   (ECM).
He   made charitable donations to   his church   and to the   Canadian   Red   Cross   Society,   both   of   which   are   a   registered Canadian charities.   He also   made   periodic donations to   the   New   Liberal   Conservative Party of Canada,a   registered Canadian   political   party.
He   has a gym   membership at an Athletic   Club   that   requires   monthly   payments.   He   made occasional contributions to   his   RRSP.
He   remits quarterly   Income tax   instalments to   CRA   based on   his   Notice of Assessment.   Instalments   include the CPP for self-employed   individuals.   He chose   not to   participate   in   EI
7.          Other: The following additional   information   relates to Zendor for 2024.
He   received   non-eligible dividends from   Pristine   Products,   Inc. and   interest   income on   a savings   account with   Fortune   National   Bank.
He   received foreign dividends on shares   he owns   in   Frontline   Corporation,   an   American   company.   22% foreign   income tax was withheld on this   dividend, and   Zendor   received   the   net   amount.   He recorded the Canadian dollar amount   on   his   Excel file.
He sold to   his sister,   Nancy,   shares   in Allister,   Ltd. that   he   had   purchased for   $50,000.      At   the   time   of the sale, the shares   had a   FMV   of   $75,000.
DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS 
1.          Ignore GST/HST/PST and   Provincial   Income Tax for this   assignment.
2.          Open the   Excel file   provided for this assignment.    Goto   Cell   1A   of the   Bank   Transaction tab   and   add
your   name and student   number.    Now   select the   row that   says   Date,   Account,   and   Amount.      Under the   Data   menu at the top of your worksheet, select “Filter”   to   create   filters   at the   top   of   each   column.
The data   has some errors and   needs to   be   cleaned.   Click   the filter   arrow   for   the “Account”   column
and   uncheck the “Select All”   button.    Next check   the   two “   Revenue   …”   accounts   to   filter   the   data   to
only show   revenue   accounts. All   revenue amounts should   be   positive.   Find three   numbers that   were   entered as   negative   numbers.   Make those   numbers   positive.    Now   remove the   checks   beside the
Revenue   accounts and select   only   Internet.    There should   have   been   12 equal   monthly   payments,   but   an error was   made one   month.      Find and fix   the   error.
3.          Go   back again to the filter arrow for the “Account”   column   and   check   the   “Select   All”   button   to   make   all the data visible   again.   Click   OK.
Now create a   PivotTable.    Click anywhere   in the   data.   From   the “Insert”   menu,   select “PivotTable”
and ‘From Table/Range’   .    In the   PivotTable   pop-up window, accept “New Worksheet”   for   the   location   for your   PivotTable.    Click OK.    Change the tab   name   for   your   new   worksheet   to   ‘2024’   and   add   your            initials.    For example, ‘2024-RAS’   .    Add your   name   and   student   ID to   Cell   1A.
In the “PivotTable   Fields”   menu on the   right-hand side of the   page,   put   a   check   mark   beside
“Account” and “Amount”   .    [Note – you   have to click 代 写MOS 3362b – Introduction to Taxation in Canada Fall 2024
代做程序编程语言  on   the   PivotTable   box   in   columns   A   –   B   to   make   the   PivotTable   Fields show   up.]
A   PivotTable should   have appeared that summarizes the total   dollar values   for   each   revenue   and
each expense account.    Change the   column   heading from   “Row   Labels”   to “Account”   and   leave the   column   heading that says, “Sum of Amount”   .    Format   numbers   so that   they   have   a   dollar   sign,   a
comma, and   no decimal   places.    Negative   numbers   should   be   shown   with   brackets,   if you   have   that   option on your computer.
4.          Click on the   PivotTable.   From the   PivotTable Analyze tab   on the   menu   bar,   select “Insert   Timeline”   .         Put a checkmark   in the   box that says “Date”   .      Click   OK.    You will   see   a   timeline   that   includes   all   the               months for   2023, 2024, and   2025.    Make   sure   that   Months   is   chosen   in   the   upper   right   corner   of   the   timeline   box.
Expand the timeline   box from the   left and from the   right so   that   the   months   of January through
December   2024 can   be seen.    Select only these   months   by   dragging   the   highlighted   bar   toward   these   months from   both sides.    This ensures that only current   year transactions   are   included   in   your
PivotTable.    When only the   months of 2024   have   been selected   and   are   visible   in your   timeline,   take   a screenshot of your timeline   and   paste   it   into   Column   B   in the Analysis tab   under   Exhibit   1 –
Timeline.   Resize to fit the   space   provided.       [Note:    do   not   use copy and   paste for the   timeline –   it   has   to   be a screenshot   or   a   picture.]
5.          Go   back to the   2024 worksheet.    You should still seeyour   Timeline   box   there.      You   can   minimize   it
and click on   it to drag   it out   of your   way,   but   do   not   remove   it.      Filter   the   PivotTable   using   the   arrow   next to “Account” and   uncheck the “Select All”   box.    Then check   only   the   boxes   next to   the   two
“   Revenue   …”   accounts.    You   now   have a   PivotTable that shows the total for the   revenue   accounts   for
2024. Copy and paste your   PivotTable   into   Columns   B and C of your Analysis   worksheet   under
Exhibit   2 –   Revenue for 2024.       Do   not   use a   screenshot   for this   part.      Adjust   columnwidth   if   needed.
6.          Go   back to the   2024 worksheet.    Click on the   PivotTable.      Under   the “PivotTable Analyze”   option   on
the   menu   bar, click on   PivotChart.    Select   pie chart.   Click   on your   chart.   Use   the   ‘+   sign’   by   the   upper            right corner of the chart   and   pick format options you   think   are   helpful.   Add   a   descriptive   title,   and   put   your   last   name at the end of the Title to   show   that   it   was   made   by   you.      Use   the   paintbrush   by   the

determined on the Analysis worksheet   and any other   information from   the   Meeting   Notes   and/or   the   Bank Transactions file to   determine Zendor’s   net   income tax   payable.
Letter to Zendor: 
At the end of your   meeting with Zendor,   he   asked you   some   important   questions   that   he   needs your help with.    Please write a   200-to-300-word   letter that   answers   his   questions.   Use   12-point   font   and single spacing.   Use a   professional format and tone.      Remember that you   are   writing TO Zendor,   not just   about   him.    Direct your   comments to   him. 
1)          He would   like to   know
•          His   income tax   payable   (or   refund) for   the   year.   If   he   owes   any   additional   amount,   when   it   needs to   be   paid.    When   his   income tax   return   is due.
• When   Barbara’s   income tax   return   is   due.
• When Janice’s   income tax   return   is   due.
•          Whether Adam   needs to file   a tax   return,   and   if   so,   when   it   is   due.      He   has   heard   that
individuals with   income   below   $15,000 do   not   need to file a   tax   return   and   would   like   you   to   clarify this.
2)    As   his   business   has grown,   he   is finding   himself too   busy   and   has   been turning away   profitable
customers due to   a   lack of time.    He   is   considering   adding   an   assistant   but   is   unsure   how to   structure   his   relationship with the assistant.    He would   like   you to   explain   how   to   distinguish   between   an employee and a self-employed contractor.      Please share   three   specific   points   with   him.
3) Zendor   has a friend,   Lawrence, who   has asked   him to   get   some   advice from   you.       Lawrence owns a
cottage   near   Huntsville,   Ontario that   he   rents out during summer   months.   He   is   planning to surprise   his wife, Cheryl,   by gifting   her the cottage   as   a   December   holiday gift.      He   wants your   advice   on   the most tax efficient   manner to transfer the   property.   He also wants to   know   the   tax   consequences   for   any future   rental   income and for the eventual sale   of the   cottage   for   himself   and for   Cheryl.   Is   it
possible for   Lawrence to avoid all future tax   implications   related to the   cottage?   If so,   please   explain      how this can   be achieved.    Lawrence   has told you   that   no   CCA   has   ever   been   claimed   on   the   cottage.
